This is a personal portfolio project to practice my frontend skills with HTML, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
This project also carries my hopes and dreams to join my favorite design and development studio :D

## Personal Takeaways
- Variables for SCSS won't be beneficial when coding responsive, but they are still good to include when coding a larger-scale project.
- In CSS, box-sizing is crucial when working with percentages to prevent any overflowing of elements.
- Use max and min for width and height to have an easier time during responsive.
- Optimizing JS may only sometimes be good in some situations. Think about readability, time usage, etc. - no need to over-complicate your code.
- File pathing is important for slugs. If you want a nice-looking URL - create a folder of the respected page name and have an index file within it.
- There is more META data to write than just description and favicon.
- Use main tag, footer tag, etc., to make the code more readable to fellow developers and SEO systems.
- Make sure to use vh as the unit instead of percentage for height since it won't transfer well to mobile.
- User test with the cursor movement before adding any smoothing since some people are not use to it.
