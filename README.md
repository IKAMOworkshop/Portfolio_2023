## Portfolio_2023

This is a personal portfolio project to practice my frontend skills with HTML, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
This project also carries my hopes and dreams to join my favorite design and development studio :D

# Personal Takeaways
- Variables for SCSS won't be beneficial when coding responsive, but they are still good to include when coding a larger-scale project.
- In CSS, box-sizing is crucial when working with percentages to prevent any overflowing of elements.
- Use max and min for width and height to have an easier time during responsive.
- Optimizing JS may not always be good in all situations. Think about readability, time usage, etc - no need to over-complicate your code.
